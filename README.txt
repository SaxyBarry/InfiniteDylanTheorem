How To Run:
    1. Ensure you have the newest version of Python3 downloaded (This can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        a. If you are on Windows, and are running into issues, make sure that the location of the Python download is placed in your PATH environment variable
    2. There are 2 ways:
        a. Terminal/Shell
            1. Using the terminal (Power Shell, Bash, Terminal etc....) navigate to the folder that `main.py` is placed
            2. Run the command: py main.py
        b. IDE
            1. If you have an IDE downloaded on your computer: IDLE or VisualStudio Code ect... 
            2. Simply open this folder in the IDE and run
    3. Enter the name of the Test Subject and hit Enter
    4. This may take a long time.... Please wait
        a.If it takes too long or begins to slow your computer significantly press: CMD + C or CTRL + C
            1. Warning: This will not give you RESULTS.TXT as you have shut down the script
    5. When the subject either completes the simulation or chooses to launch the nuclear weapons, you will see a directory titled the name of the subject, date and time of when the simulation began, opening that will show you every run of the experiment as well as the results.

What is this?:
    This is a simulation of the Infinite Monkey Theorem: a thought experiment that states that given an immortal monkey, a type writer and infinite time, the monkey would be able to create any body of work imaginable simply by pressing keys at random on the type writer. People usually associate this thought experiment with the works of William Shakespeare like Hamlet or MacBeth. In this experiment, the subject will be attempting to recreate the entire Constitution of the United States. While this may seem an impossible task, processions have been made to give the subject a better chance. Punctuation has and excess spacing/new line characters have all been removed from the keyboard and text, doing this significantly increases the likelihood. In exchange, the subject has been placed in a room with a large, shiny, red button. Upon pressing this button, the worst fears of the entire World will be realized: Complete Nuclear Annihilation. This is a race against time. The subject will dictate that fate of the World: Will the subject choose nuclear annihilation, or will they be able to successfully recreate one of the most prolific governing documents ever conceived? The people of the World hold their breath.

Why is this?:
    When making this, I took inspiration from 2 main sources:
        1. The Infinite Monkey Theorem 
        2. Masters Of War by Bob Dylan
    Masters of War touches upon the topic of absurdity, the absurdity that politicians have so much control over who lives and who dies, or when it is necessary for someone to lay down their life in the name of "freedom" or "peace". These politicians are out of touch and simply grabbing at power that shouldn't be given to them. Dylan takes a very serious, direct approach in his discussion of this topic, while I am taking a much more obscure absurd approach here. I wanted to display just how ridiculous and out of touch these politicians truly are. Representing them as monkeys slapping at a keyboard in hopes of creating a piece of legislature, while also giving them the option to destroy the world at any moment is my way of showing this.
